Hospital operations face  numerous challenges, such as  inefﬁcient workﬂows, communication gaps, and lack of  real-time data. These challenges  can lead to delays, errors, and  increased costs. An advanced
management system can  address these issues by providing  streamlined processes, improved  communication, and access to  real-time data. Implementing an advanced management  system offers several beneﬁts, including  optimized resource allocation, improved  patient care, and increased cost sa vings. By
automating processes, hospitals can allocate resources efﬁciently, enhance patient care  through better coordination, and reduce  costs associated with manual tasks.
